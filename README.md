TASK 1: This task involves utilizing machine learning techniques on the houseprice_data.csv dataset, which contains detailed information on house sales in King County, USA, including 18 features like bedroom count, bathroom count, and floors. The primary objective is constructing a linear regression model to predict house prices accurately. Following model development, a comprehensive analysis will be conducted to assess the model's effectiveness, employing metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE). Furthermore, potential model enhancements, such as feature engineering or regularization techniques, will be explored to optimize predictive performance. Valuable insights into factors influencing house prices in King County were uncovered through this analysis. they were facilitating informed decision-making in real estate investments and pricing strategies.# Projects
TASK 2: The project involves applying a machine learning clustering algorithm to the country_data.csv dataset, which contains information about countries' child mortality rates, exports, health spending, and other relevant features. The objective is to explore the dataset using clustering techniques, visualize the resulting clusters, and analyze the findings. The analysis draws conclusions based on the clusters, considering factors such as the inclusion or exclusion of specific features and their impact on the clustering results. Additionally, the project aims to provide insights and recommendations within the context of the data, based on the clustering outcomes.
